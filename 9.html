<br><br>
A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmatic or logical operations.Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
<br>
<h5 id="cpu">cpu</h5>
A central processing unit(CPU),also refered to as a central processing unit is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a ccomputer program by performing the basic arithmetical,logical and input/output operations of the system.The term has been in use in the computer industry atleast since the early 1960's.The form,design and implementation of CPU's have changed over the course of their history,but their fundamental operation remains much the same.
<br>
<h2 id="alu">ALU</h2>
In computing an arithmetic and logic unit(ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithmetic and logical operations.The ALU is a fundamenta building block of the central processing unit of the computer,and even the simplest microprocessor contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers.The processors found inside mordern CPU's and graphics processing unit(GPU's) accomodate very powerfull and very complex ALU's.A single compound may contain a number of ALU's.

A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmatic or logical operations.Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
<br>
<h2 id="c">c</h2>
C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time and C compilers are available for the majority of computer architectures and operating systems.
<br>
<h2 id="c++">c<sup>++</sup></h2>
C++ (pronounced see plus plus) is a programming language that is general purpose ,statically typed,free-form,multi paradigm and compiled.it is regearded as an immidiate level language as it comprises both high-level and low-level language features
<br>

<h2 id="dbms">DBMS</h2><br>
A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.
<br>
<h2 id="rdbms">RDBMS</h2>
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. In 2017, many of the databases in widespread use are based on the relational database model.
<br>
<h2 id="oodbms">OODBMS</h2>
 An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.
<br>
<h2 id="hdbms">HDBMS</h2>
HDBMS (Hierarchical Database Management System) is a type of DBMS that supports a hierarchical data model. Example HDBMS Systems: Lotus Notes (the most popular HDBMS in use today) IMS - IBM's Information Management System (first HDBMS)
<br>
<h2 id="nwdbms">NWDBMS</h2>
A NDBMS (Network Database Management System) is a type of DBMS system that supports the network data model. Example: IBM's IDMS, mainly used on Mainframe Systems. Glossary of Terms.
